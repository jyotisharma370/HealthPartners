This Solution is created to write FizzBuzz program following Solid princliples and TDD.

1- I have added interface into interface folder and implemented it into Fizzbuzzer class in ClassLibrary project.
2- I have added unit tests using Nunit framework in unit test project.
3- I have added logic to run Fizzbuzz in console in console application.

hence, 3 projects added to one solution. console app is set to startup project as we need to see fizzbuzz output in console.
